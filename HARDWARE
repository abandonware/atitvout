Features:
 
  Rage Mobility/Rage LT: 

	All functions. Some cards seem not to be able to use TV and LCD
    simultaneously. Some cards do not support TV standard switching.

  Rage 128/Radeon

    TV standard switching is supported. BIOS enables TVout
    automatically when it's connected before PC boot. Other
    things depend on BIOS implementation.
    NOTE: All changes will be activated only at the next
    set_mode call. Thus if you disable CRT output then you 
    will be able to enable it again only through TV screen
    (as usual after next set_mode call).
