Actually, I've figured it out since then. :)  The tvout only works at
lower resolutions, so if I switch to 800x600 first it works
perfect.  You might want to make a note of this on the web site for
other m3 owners.  The only thing not working now is simultaneous output on
the lcd and tvout, but I can live without that. 

Thanks for writing this util, it's the only thing that was unsupported on
this laptop in linux. :)

Hi,
Atitvout works for me:) Thanks for this utility!
Card: Radeon 64 ddr vivo

Here's the output of some commands, in case you're interested:

# atitvout vbe
VBE Version: 2.0
VBE OEM Identification: ATI RAGE128

# atitvout tvout
TV Out is enabled.
Reference frequency is 27.00000 Hz
***well, it says the same whether tv out is really enabled or not

# atitvout standard
VBE call failed.
Maybe this command is not supported by your graphics adapter?
Did your parameters (if you specified some) really make sense?
Please try all other available commands before complaining!

# atitvout detect ***when tv is connected
TV is attached via Composite.

# atitvout detect ***when tv is not connected
No TV is attached.

# atitvout active
TV is active.
***this always says tv is active

commands t, ct and auto always enable both crt (50Hz) and tv out
atitvout c restores the normal crt mode

 -Henri
